I have included some notes below regarding the process and challenges I faced.

Initial:

I started by breaking down the HiFi into build elements (Static & Animated)

I then identified any potential roadblocks as well as which languages to use during development (html, css, sass, javascript & jQuery)

From here, I moved to the build.

The first roadblock identified was the requirement for a use of Demonstrate the use of a task runner and use of precompiled styles. Items I am aware of but have never used. This resulted in a crash course on Sass and Grunt/Gulp.

Following this, I proceeded with the static build (Ensuring mobile responsiveness was always a priority), something I am very comfortable with as I work nearly every day in html, css, wordpress & hubspot. One I had the components built, I moved on to the more technical elements, the re-usable components & animations.

This put me outside of my comfort zone as I tend to rely on using frameworks to achieve this. I have tried to balance the need for meeting a delivery to the Fostr team and not wanting to spend more capacity on this than I currently have available. Given more time I would have committed more resources to a more streamlined cart animation.

Lastly will be my first attempt at using Grunt to bundle my js file. At the time of this writing, this is still underway. (Grunt has now been installed)

I hope to discuss the role further and meet the team to gain a better understanding of the requirements of the role.

Kind Regards

Luke
